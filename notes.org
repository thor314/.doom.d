#+TITLE: Notes
* Doom config Notes
** TODO dec 9 This is a todo to test magit-todos.
I still have to fix variable pitch font, and figure out what it takes to install a package.
** DONE Note to also check grammar check
** DONE Unsetting t and T:
Resolution: run a couple tests with the map! macro, and discover :after evil works pretty well.

I'm trying to unset the `t` and `T` keys. I look them up: `SPC h k t`, which returns:
```
Key Bindings
evil-snipe-override-local-mode-map <motion-state> t
evil-snipe-override-mode-map <motion-state> t
```
So I tried the following:
```
(undefine-key! evil-snipe-override-local-mode-map "t" "T")
(undefine-key! evil-snipe-override-mode-map "t" "T")
(map! :map 'evil-normal-state-map
      :n "t" #'transpose-chars
      :n "T" #'transpose-sexps)
```
and `M-x doom/reload`, but `t` and `T` are still bound. What else do I do?
